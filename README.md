Material for the Applications course on Machine Learning at the MSc in Omics Data Analysis of the University of Vic (UVic).

To work with the code contained in this repository you will need Python 3. The packages needed are already defined by the conda environment contained into the .yml file, including the Jupyter Notebook format used for the code. Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download) is a popular package manager that facilitates sharing environments for reproducible science. You can have Python and Anaconda on any operating system.

In order to install the conda environment use `conda env create -f MScOmicsVic.yml` from the terminal on a UNIX-based system or from the Anaconda Prompt terminal on Windows (it will be available on your system applications after installing Anaconda on Windows). The environment includes jupyter notebook, so after installing the environment from the file and activating it (`conda activate MScOmicsVic`) you will only need to install the environment on the notebook through `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=MScOmicsVic` and start the jupyter notebook (`jupyter notebook`). Once inside the Notebook, you can change the kernel to the environment.
